# Use Header 1 markdown to create a new slide and add the slide title...

For some reason if you put a second header level on the first slide it screws everthing up, so don't do it!

I tried adding a background color, but didn't like it...  All formatting can be changed in the CSS if there's anything you don't like...

# Slide 2

## You can put subheaders on all other slides just not the first one

### Bullets look like this:

- What is data visualization?
- History of data visualization
- Why do we need it?
- What makes a good visualization?

# Slide 3

## Code looks like this...

```{r}
# Create my_data
my_data <- mtcars
# Print the first 6 rows
head(my_data, 6)
```

# Slide 4

## Plots look like this...

```{r}
plot(x = my_data$wt, y = my_data$mpg,
     pch = 16, frame = FALSE,
     xlab = "wt", ylab = "mpg", col = "#2E9FDF")
```

# Header levels - Header 1 Title

## Header 2 looks like this...

### Header 3 looks like this...

#### Header 4 looks like this...

##### Header 5 looks like this...

###### Header 6 looks like this...

# Tables

## use html tables like below to arrange items like images

<table align="center">
